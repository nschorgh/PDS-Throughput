Utilities for High-Throughput PDS Data Processing
=================================================

*by Norbert Schorghofer*


These are the first components of a collection of utitilies for high-throughput processing of data from the PDS (Planetary Data System).

Formats:  
* Diviner RDR level-1 files




### Throughput Studies

`prepfiles.cmd`  
    creates files of various compression formats

`timedecompress1.cmd`  
    measures time for file decompression

`Parallel/`  
    `timeparallel.cmd`: measure times for parallel file decompresson and filtering  
    `parallel_*.cmd`: shell scripts called by timeparallel.cmd  


### Throughput Tools

To be developed.
