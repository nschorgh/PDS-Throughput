Utilities for High-Throughput PDS Data Processing
=================================================

*by Norbert Schorghofer*


These are the first components of a collection of utitilies for high-throughput processing of data from the PDS (Planetary Data System).

Formats:  
* Diviner RDR level-1 files




### Throughput Studies

`prepfiles.cmd`  creates files of various compression formats

`timedecompress1.cmd`, `timedecompress1_stdout.cmd`  measure time for file decompression

`Parallel/timeparallelfilter.cmd`: measures times for parallel file decompresson and filtering  
`Parallel/filter1_*.cmd`: shell scripts called by timeparallelfilter.cmd  


### Throughput Tools

To be developed.
