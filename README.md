Utilities for High-Throughput PDS Data Processing
=================================================

*by Norbert Schorghofer*


These are the first components of a collection of utitilies for high-throughput processing of data from the PDS (Planetary Data System).

Formats:  
* Diviner RDR level-1 files




### Throughput Studies

`prepfiles*.cmd`  creates files of various compression formats

`timedecompress1*.cmd`  measures time for file decompression  
`timedecompress.cmd`  measures time for file compression  

`Parallel/timeparallelfilter.cmd`  measures times for parallel file decompresson and filtering  
`Parallel/filter1_*.cmd`  shell scripts called by timeparallelfilter.cmd  


### Throughput Tools

To be developed.
